        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        sequence: A number to uniquely identify item entries.

        careTeamSequence: CareTeam members related to this service or product.

        diagnosisSequence: Diagnosis applicable for this service or product.

        procedureSequence: Procedures applicable for this service or product.

        informationSequence: Exceptions, special conditions and supporting information applicable for this
            service or product.

        revenue: The type of revenue or cost center providing the product and/or service.

        category: Code to identify the general type of benefits under which products and
            services are provided.

        productOrService: When the value is a group code then this item collects a set of related claim
            details, otherwise this contains the product, service, drug or other billing
            code for the item.

        modifier: Item typification or modifiers codes to convey additional context for the
            product or service.

        programCode: Identifies the program under which this may be recovered.

        servicedDate: The date or dates when the service or product was supplied, performed or
            completed.

        servicedPeriod: The date or dates when the service or product was supplied, performed or
            completed.

        locationCodeableConcept: Where the product or service was provided.

        locationAddress: Where the product or service was provided.

        locationReference: Where the product or service was provided.

        quantity: The number of repetitions of a service or product.

        unitPrice: If the item is not a group then this is the fee for the product or service,
            otherwise this is the total of the fees for the details of the group.

        factor: A real number that represents a multiplier used in determining the overall
            value of services delivered and/or goods received. The concept of a Factor
            allows for a discount or surcharge multiplier to be applied to a monetary
            amount.

        net: The quantity times the unit price for an additional service or product or
            charge.

        subSite: A region or surface of the bodySite, e.g. limb region or tooth surface(s).

        encounter: The Encounters during which this Claim was created or to which the creation of
            this record is tightly associated.

        detail: A claim detail line. Either a simple (a product or service) or a 'group' of
