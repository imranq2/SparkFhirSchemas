        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        sequence: A number to uniquely identify insurance entries and provide a sequence of
            coverages to convey coordination of benefit order.

        focal: A flag to indicate that this Coverage is to be used for adjudication of this
            claim when set to true.

        identifier: The business identifier to be used when the claim is sent for adjudication
            against this insurance policy.

        coverage: Reference to the insurance card level information contained in the Coverage
            resource. The coverage issuing insurer will use these details to locate the
            patient's actual coverage within the insurer's information system.

        businessArrangement: A business agreement number established between the provider and the insurer
            for special business processing purposes.

        preAuthRef: Reference numbers previously provided by the insurer to the provider to be
            quoted on subsequent claims containing services or products related to the
            prior authorization.

        claimResponse: The result of the adjudication of the line items for the Coverage specified in
            this insurance.
