        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

        identifier: Substance identifier for each non-natural or radioisotope.

        name: Substance name for each non-natural or radioisotope.

        substitution: The type of isotopic substitution present in a single substance.

        halfLife: Half life - for a non-natural nuclide.

        molecularWeight: The molecular weight or weight range (for proteins, polymers or nucleic
            acids).
