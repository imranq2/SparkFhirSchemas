        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of

        type: The type of channel to send notifications on.

        endpoint: The url that describes the actual end-point to send messages to.

        payload: The mime type to send the payload in - either application/fhir+xml, or
            application/fhir+json. If the payload is not present, then there is no payload
            in the notification, just a notification. The mime type "text/plain" may also
            be used for Email and SMS subscriptions.

        header: Additional headers / information to send as part of the notification.
