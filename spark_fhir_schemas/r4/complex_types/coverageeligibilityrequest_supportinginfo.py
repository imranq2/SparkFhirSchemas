        The CoverageEligibilityRequest provides patient and insurance coverage
        information to an insurer for them to respond, in the form of an
        CoverageEligibilityResponse, with information regarding whether the stated
        coverage is valid and in-force and optionally to provide the insurance details
        of the policy.


        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource

        sequence: A number to uniquely identify supporting information entries.

        information: Additional data or information such as resources, documents, images etc.
            including references to the data or the actual inclusion of the data.

        appliesToAll: The supporting materials are applicable for all detail items, product/servce
            categories and specific billing codes.
