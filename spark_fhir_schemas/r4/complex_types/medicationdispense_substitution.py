        Indicates that a medication product is to be or has been dispensed for a named
        person/patient.  This includes a description of the medication product
        (supply) provided and the instructions for administering the medication.  The
        medication dispense is the result of a pharmacy system responding to a
        medication order.


        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        wasSubstituted: True if the dispenser dispensed a different drug or product from what was
            prescribed.

        type: A code signifying whether a different drug was dispensed from what was
            prescribed.

        reason: Indicates the reason for the substitution (or lack of substitution) from what
            was prescribed.

        responsibleParty: The person or organization that has primary responsibility for the
            substitution.
