        A set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a
        single logical package that provides a single coherent statement of meaning,
        establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to
        who is making the statement. A Composition defines the structure and narrative
        content necessary for a document. However, a Composition alone does not
        constitute a document. Rather, the Composition must be the first entry in a
        Bundle where Bundle.type=document, and any other resources referenced from
        Composition must be included as subsequent entries in the Bundle (for example
        Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, etc.).


        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        code: This list of codes represents the main clinical acts, such as a colonoscopy or
            an appendectomy, being documented. In some cases, the event is inherent in the
            typeCode, such as a "History and Physical Report" in which the procedure being
            documented is necessarily a "History and Physical" act.

        period: The period of time covered by the documentation. There is no assertion that
            the documentation is a complete representation for this period, only that it
            documents events during this time.

        detail: The description and/or reference of the event(s) being documented. For
            example, this could be used to document such a colonoscopy or an appendectomy.
