        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

        type: Type of subcomponent of certainty rating.

        rating: A rating of a subcomponent of rating certainty.

        note: A human-readable string to clarify or explain concepts about the resource.
