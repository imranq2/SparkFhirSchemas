        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource

        context: Type or variable this rule applies to.

        contextType: How to interpret the context.

        element: Field to create in the context.

        variable: Named context for field, if desired, and a field is specified.

        listMode: If field is a list, how to manage the list.

        listRuleId: Internal rule reference for shared list items.

        transform: How the data is copied / created.

        parameter: Parameters to the transform.
