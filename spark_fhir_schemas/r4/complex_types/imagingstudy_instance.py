        Representation of the content produced in a DICOM imaging study. A study
        comprises a set of series, each of which includes a set of Service-Object Pair
        Instances (SOP Instances - images or other data) acquired or produced in a
        common context.  A series is of only one modality (e.g. X-ray, CT, MR,
        ultrasound), but a study may have multiple series of different modalities.


        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        uid: The DICOM SOP Instance UID for this image or other DICOM content.

        sopClass: DICOM instance  type.

        number: The number of instance in the series.

        title: The description of the instance.
