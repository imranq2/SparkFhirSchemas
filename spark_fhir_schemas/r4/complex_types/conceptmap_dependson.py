        A statement of relationships from one set of concepts to one or more other
        concepts - either concepts in code systems, or data element/data element
        concepts, or classes in class models.


        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        property: A reference to an element that holds a coded value that corresponds to a code
            system property. The idea is that the information model carries an element
            somewhere that is labeled to correspond with a code system property.

        system: An absolute URI that identifies the code system of the dependency code (if the
            source/dependency is a value set that crosses code systems).

        value: Identity (code or path) or the element/item/ValueSet/text that the map depends
            on / refers to.

        display: The display for the code. The display is only provided to help editors when
            editing the concept map.
