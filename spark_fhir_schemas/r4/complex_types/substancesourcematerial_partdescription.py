        Source material shall capture information on the taxonomic and anatomical
        origins as well as the fraction of a material that can result in or can be
        modified to form a substance. This set of data elements shall be used to
        define polymer substances isolated from biological matrices. Taxonomic and
        anatomical origins shall be described using a controlled vocabulary as
        required. This information is captured for naturally derived polymers ( .
        starch) and structurally diverse substances. For Organisms belonging to the
        Kingdom Plantae the Substance level defines the fresh material of a single
        species or infraspecies, the Herbal Drug and the Herbal preparation. For
        Herbal preparations, the fraction information will be captured at the
        Substance information level and additional information for herbal extracts
        will be captured at the Specified Substance Group 1 information level. See for
        further explanation the Substance Class: Structurally Diverse and the herbal
        annex.


        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of

            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        part: Entity of anatomical origin of source material within an organism.

        partLocation: The detailed anatomic location when the part can be extracted from different
            anatomical locations of the organism. Multiple alternative locations may
            apply.
