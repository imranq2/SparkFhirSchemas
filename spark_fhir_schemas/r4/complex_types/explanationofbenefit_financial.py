        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource

        type: Classification of benefit being provided.

        allowedUnsignedInt: The quantity of the benefit which is permitted under the coverage.

        allowedString: The quantity of the benefit which is permitted under the coverage.

        allowedMoney: The quantity of the benefit which is permitted under the coverage.

        usedUnsignedInt: The quantity of the benefit which have been consumed to date.

        usedMoney: The quantity of the benefit which have been consumed to date.
