        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

        name: The actual name.

        type: Name type.

        status: The status of the name.

        preferred: If this is the preferred name for this substance.

        language: Language of the name.

        domain: The use context of this name for example if there is a different name a drug
            active ingredient as opposed to a food colour additive.

        jurisdiction: The jurisdiction where this name applies.

        synonym: A synonym of this name.

        translation: A translation for this name.

        official: Details of the official nature of this name.
