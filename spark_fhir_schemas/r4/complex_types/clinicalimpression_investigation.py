        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of

        code: A name/code for the group ("set") of investigations. Typically, this will be
            something like "signs", "symptoms", "clinical", "diagnostic", but the list is
            not constrained, and others such groups such as
            (exposure|family|travel|nutritional) history may be used.

        item: A record of a specific investigation that was undertaken.
