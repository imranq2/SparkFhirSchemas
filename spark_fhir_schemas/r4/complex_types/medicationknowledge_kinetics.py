        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource

        areaUnderCurve: The drug concentration measured at certain discrete points in time.

        lethalDose50: The median lethal dose of a drug.

        halfLifePeriod: The time required for any specified property (e.g., the concentration of a
            substance in the body) to decrease by half.
