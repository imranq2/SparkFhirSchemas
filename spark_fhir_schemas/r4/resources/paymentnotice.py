        This resource provides the status of the payment for goods and services

        resourceType: This is a PaymentNotice resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this payment notice.

        status: The status of the resource instance.

        request: Reference of resource for which payment is being made.

        response: Reference of response to resource for which payment is being made.

        created: The date when this resource was created.

        provider: The practitioner who is responsible for the services rendered to the patient.

        payment: A reference to the payment which is the subject of this notice.

        paymentDate: The date when the above payment action occurred.

        payee: The party who will receive or has received payment that is the subject of this
            notification.

        recipient: The party who is notified of the payment status.

        amount: The amount sent to the payee.

        paymentStatus: A code indicating whether payment has been sent or cleared.
